# Data from:
# Diet quality in a wild grazer declines under the 
# threat of an ambush predator
# Barnier et al. (2015)
# Proc. R. Soc. B 281: 20140446.
# http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2014.0446


#From the abstract:
# Predators influence prey populations not only through predation 
# itself, but also indirectly through prompting changes in prey 
# behaviour. The behavioural adjustments of prey to predation 
# risk may carry nutritional costs, but this has seldom been 
# studied in the wild in large mammals. Here, we studied the
# effects of an ambush predator, the African lion (Panthera leo), 
# on the diet quality of plains zebras (Equus quagga) in Hwange 
# National Park, Zimbabwe. We combined information on movements 
# of both prey and predators, using GPS data, and measurements 
# of faecal crude protein, an index of diet quality in the prey.
# Zebras which had been in close proximity to lions had a lower 
# quality diet, showing that adjustments in behaviour when lions 
# are within short distance carry nutritional costs. The ultimate 
# fitness cost will depend on the frequency of predatorâ€“prey 
# encounters and on whether bottom-up or top-down forces are more 
# important in the prey population. Our finding is the first attempt
# to our knowledge to assess nutritionally mediated risk effects 
# in a large mammalian prey species under the threat of an ambush 
# predator, and brings support to the hypothesis that the 
# behavioural effects of predation induce important risk effects 
# on prey populations.

#In short:
# 1. Zebras are tagged. Lions are tagged. So we know the distances
#    between them.
# 2. Zebra faecel samples are collected. Crude protein (CP) content 
#    is measured (CP in the diet is important for growth and 
#    reporduction in horses).
# 3. Setup of the experiment:
#       65 Facel samples from 30 individuals in 8 harems.
#       Multiple days.


# Response variable: CP
# Covariates: Sex (male, female). 
#             Distance to lions. Categorical (close, far) 
#                                This is minimum distance. 
#                                It is a predation index/risk

# Random effects:
# From the paper: 
# 1. We included a random effect on the intercept for 
#    data collected on the same day in the same group, 
#    thus accounting for the fact that samples coming 
#    from members of the same harem on the same date 
#    were correlated. 

#    Highstat: Coding required for the day-group identifier:
Zebra$fHaremDate  <- factor(paste(Zebra$Group, 
                                  Zebra$Date, 
                                  sep = "_"))
#and then (1 | fHaremDate) in lme4

# 2. We also included a random effect on the intercept 
#    for individuals nested in harems, to take account 
#    of repeated measures on individuals and groups.

#    Highstat: We think they used: (1 | fIndividual)
#    This would make sense to: (1 | fGroup / fIndividual)
#    but the small sample size may not allow it.

#    3. A random effect varying among individuals nested 
#       in harems was included on the coefficient relating 
#       distance to lions to CP in the faeces, to allow 
#       for different reactions to risk of predation between 
#       individuals in their groups,  

#     Highstat: We guess they used: (1 + fDistance | fGoup / fIndividual)
#     So..a random slope.

# So..the random error structre used in the paper is of the form:
# (1 | fHaremDate) + (1 + fDistance | fGroup / fIndividual) 
# We hope they have a large data set!

#Protocol for mixed modelling (3 steps).
#Based on Zuur et al. (2013).
#Beginner's Guide to GLM and GLMM with R

#1. Based on prior knowledge of the dependency
#   structure in the data, select the random
#   structure (i.e. the random effects) a priori.
#2. Fit the model and investigate which covariates
#   in the fixed part are significant or important.
#   Alternatively, omit model selection on the
#   covariates and adopt an information theoretic
#   approach (specify and compare 10-15 models).
#3. When the optimal model has been found, present
#   the numerical output and provide a graphic
#   representation of the model fit.

#In step 2 you may want to consider applying a limited amount of model
#selection...e.g. drop non-significant interactions.
