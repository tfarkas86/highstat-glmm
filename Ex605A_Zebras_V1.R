# Data from:
# Diet quality in a wild grazer declines under the 
# threat of an ambush predator
# Barnier et al. (2015)
# Proc. R. Soc. B 281: 20140446.# http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2014.0446


#From the abstract:
# Predators influence prey populations not only through predation 
# itself, but also indirectly through prompting changes in prey 
# behaviour. The behavioural adjustments of prey to predation 
# risk may carry nutritional costs, but this has seldom been 
# studied in the wild in large mammals. Here, we studied the# effects of an ambush predator, the African lion (Panthera leo), 
# on the diet quality of plains zebras (Equus quagga) in Hwange 
# National Park, Zimbabwe. We combined information on movements 
# of both prey and predators, using GPS data, and measurements 
# of faecal crude protein, an index of diet quality in the prey.# Zebras which had been in close proximity to lions had a lower 
# quality diet, showing that adjustments in behaviour when lions 
# are within short distance carry nutritional costs. The ultimate 
# fitness cost will depend on the frequency of predatorâ€“prey 
# encounters and on whether bottom-up or top-down forces are more 
# important in the prey population. Our finding is the first attempt# to our knowledge to assess nutritionally mediated risk effects 
# in a large mammalian prey species under the threat of an ambush 
# predator, and brings support to the hypothesis that the 
# behavioural effects of predation induce important risk effects 
# on prey populations.

#In short:
# 1. Zebras are tagged. Lions are tagged. So we know the distances
#    between them.
# 2. Zebra faecel samples are collected. Crude protein (CP) content 
#    is measured (CP in the diet is important for growth and 
#    reporduction in horses).
# 3. Setup of the experiment:
#       65 Facel samples from 30 individuals in 8 harems.
#       Multiple days.


# Response variable: CP
# Covariates: Sex (male, female). 
#             Distance to lions. Categorical (close, far) 
#                                This is minimum distance. 
#                                It is a predation index/risk

# Random effects:
# From the paper: 
# 1. We included a random effect on the intercept for 
#    data collected on the same day in the same group, 
#    thus accounting for the fact that samples coming 
#    from members of the same harem on the same date 
#    were correlated. 

#    Highstat: Coding required for the day-group identifier:
Zebra$fHaremDate  <- factor(paste(Zebra$Group, 
                                  Zebra$Date, 
                                  sep = "_"))
#and then (1 | fHaremDate) in lme4

# 2. We also included a random effect on the intercept 
#    for individuals nested in harems, to take account 
#    of repeated measures on individuals and groups.

#    Highstat: We think they used: (1 | fIndividual)
#    This would make sense to: (1 | fGroup / fIndividual)
#    but the small sample size may not allow it.

#    3. A random effect varying among individuals nested 
#       in harems was included on the coefficient relating 
#       distance to lions to CP in the faeces, to allow 
#       for different reactions to risk of predation between 
#       individuals in their groups,  

#     Highstat: We guess they used: (1 + fDistance | fGoup / fIndividual)
#     So..a random slope.

# So..the random error structre used in the paper is of the form:
# (1 | fHaremDate) + (1 + fDistance | fGroup / fIndividual) 
# We hope they have a large data set!

#Protocol for mixed modelling (3 steps).
#Based on Zuur et al. (2013).
#Beginner's Guide to GLM and GLMM with R

#1. Based on prior knowledge of the dependency
#   structure in the data, select the random
#   structure (i.e. the random effects) a priori.
#2. Fit the model and investigate which covariates
#   in the fixed part are significant or important.
#   Alternatively, omit model selection on the
#   covariates and adopt an information theoretic
#   approach (specify and compare 10-15 models).
#3. When the optimal model has been found, present
#   the numerical output and provide a graphic
#   representation of the model fit.

#Step 1 of the protocol

library(lme4)
# I think that the random slope stuff is too complicated for this
# data set.
M1 <- lmer(CP ~ fDistance + fSex + (1  | fIndividual) + (1 | fHaremDate),
           data = Zebra, 
           REML = TRUE)
summary(M1)

# Are distance and sex significant? 
# To answer this question, create 95% CIs,
# and notice that 0 is not on the 95% CI 
# interval for Distance, but the beta for 
# sex is. So distance is significant but sex 
# is not.

# Also note that the sigma for individual is 0.
# Should we drop it and simplify the random error 
# structure? Sounds sensible!


#Model validation.
#Everything ok?
#Take residuals.....
#1.1 - Plot residuals versus fitted values
#1.2 - Plot residuals versus each covariate in the model
#1.3 - Plot residuals versus each covariate NOT in the model
#1.4 - Plot residuals versus time (if relevant)
#1.5 - Plot residuals versus spatial coordinates

     ylab = "Residuals")
abline(v = 0, lwd = 2, col = 2)
abline(h = 0, lty = 2, col = 1)
#Some funny patterns for larger fitted values!
#No negative fitted values

#Good

boxplot(E1 ~ fSex, data = Zebra)

#Ok-ish


#1.3: Not relevant here

#1.4: Not relevant here

#1.5  Not relevant here

#Results model validation:
#Looks ok...no structure in residuals...go to step 2


##########################################################
#Step 2
#Is everything significant? To answer
#this question we can use three different approaches in a
#frequentist approach:
#A. Use p-values of t-statistics (or z-statistics)
#B. Ue F test
#C. Use likelihood ratio test


#We have already done step A...and discovered that distance
#is significant, and sex is not.

#Approach C (likelihood ratio test)
#But the data set is small!!

drop1(M1a, test = "Chi")
#Same conclusion

#Step 3: Presents results (REML gives better estimates of the sigmas...
#        so use REML for final presentation).
#        So that is M1

#Understand the output:
